# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This is a basic chatting web app that I have made using Flask( a micro framework) and JavaScript
When one opens the website, they are prompted with a display page. Where they enter a unique name to be used. They are then directed to the home page

The homepage loads the last channel before the browser was closed and the messages it had if there are any.
One has an option to create a channel which should be unique otherwise a message is displayed to tell the user that the name has been taken. The user can then join a specified channel and then send messages to other people
there is a maximum of the number of messages the server can hold for a particular channel
