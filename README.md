Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This is a basic chatting web app that I have made using Flask( a micro framework) and JavaScript

The first page users get directed to prompts them to enter their username. The name, by nature is unique and is to be used to identify the participant in the group chats they participate in. 

Once the user selects a name by the click of a button, they are redirected to the homepage.The homepage contains the last channel before the browser was closed and the messages that the channel had(if there are any).

### Features:
---
1. Creating a channel with a unique name. Users will be informed if they try to create a channel using a name that is already taken.
2. Join an already existing channel.

**P.S:**
----
> 1. There is limit set for the messages that the server can hold for a particular channel.   
> 2. I've created a walkthrough showing the web application at work and I've made it public on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/_IkeP64QXHc)
